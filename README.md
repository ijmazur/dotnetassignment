# Scheduler

Scheduler, created using ASP.NET MVC, is a simple and efficient web app, which allows users to create and manage their own schedules with the intent of trying to improve time management. 


## Main Landing Page

Main page includes a welcoming, hearthwarming picture warning people not to click on the href link, which actually redirects you to the core of the app - creating a schedule. 


## Creating a Schedule

User has to input the name of a task they wish to complete, description of it, starting date, as well as finishing. All of the input fields are validated for empty input - the app does not allow the user to create an empty nor incomplete task.

Once a new task is created, we receive a notification

## Editing the Scheduler

You can edit your schedule at any given time.

Once you finish editing the details of a given task, it gets updated automatically on the main page. 
The user is also notified that changes have been applied

Users are also able to delete the entries they have completed or decided to give up on.

This view has disabled input fields and the only action is to either delete the task or return to the main page.
